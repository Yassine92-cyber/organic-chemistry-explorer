## 🎯 **Testing Options**

### **Option 1: Frontend-Only Testing (Immediate)**
Since you want to test on `localhost:5173`, you'll need Node.js:

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Follow the installation wizard

2. **Start the Enhanced Frontend:**
   ```bash
   # In the project root
   npm install          # Install enhanced dependencies
   npm run dev         # Start Vite dev server on localhost:5173
   ```

### **Option 2: Backend Testing (Enhanced Features)**
```bash
# From the backend directory
cd backend
python quick_demo.py    # See all enhanced features working
```

### **Option 3: Full-Stack Testing**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start enhanced backend
cd backend
python start_main_server.py

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced frontend  
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 **If Node.js Installation Not Possible**

### **Alternative 1: Use the Static Files**
Open `index.html` directly in your browser:
```bash
# Open this file in your browser:
file:///C:/Users/drkad/OneDrive/Variety/Desktop/Vibe%20coding%20projects/orme/index.html
```

### **Alternative 2: Test Enhanced Backend Only**
The enhanced backend features are fully working:
```bash
cd backend
python quick_demo.py
```

**Output Preview:**
